# About
This challenge was a hiring challenge by SumoLogic and I was supposed to make the UI from an API i was provided with. The Website was supposed to resemble an online File Manager where a user can perform CRUD operations on any File or Folder as well as drag and drop files from one location to another. This was a 12 hour challenge.

# Dependencies
 - the project uses React.js as the framework of Choice
 - the project uses json-server as a mock server to act as an API.

# Features
 - Modularized Code Structure
 - Component Based Architecture (Components could have been made better and more independent but Limited Time was the bottleneck)
 - Responsive Design
 - File Structure Implemented
 - Better and Scalable Database design
